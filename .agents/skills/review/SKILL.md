# PR Reviewer

Review a pull request. The user provides a PR number.

Steps:
1. Get PR info: `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,files`
2. Get diff (safe mode, no checkout): `gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>`
3. Review the diff against project conventions (see AGENTS.md):
   - **Code style**: Rust Edition 2024 conventions, proper error handling (thiserror), async-trait usage
   - **Type safety**: proper Rust types, no unwrap() in production code, proper error propagation
   - **API conventions**: consistent endpoint patterns, proper error response format (ProxyError)
   - **Test coverage**: new code should have corresponding tests
   - **Security**: no hardcoded API keys, no secrets in code, proper auth checks
   - **Provider compatibility**: changes should not break existing provider support
   - **Spec & Reference doc sync**: do docs/reference/ updates needed? Is there a related Spec?
   - **Config compatibility**: config.yaml changes should be backward compatible
4. Output a structured review:

```
